# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction
This project is a movie recommendation system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze movie data and provide personalized movie recommendations. Built using Python, the system takes in CSV files containing movie data, performs various analyses, and predicts user preferences based on their movie watching history and preferences.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze movie datasets to understand trends, preferences, and patterns.
- **Recommendation Algorithms:** Implements several machine learning algorithms to provide accurate movie recommendations.
- **Personalization:** Tailors recommendations based on individual user's preferences and past interactions.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
